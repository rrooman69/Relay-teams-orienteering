# Relay-teams-orienteering
Create the best possible orienteering relay teams for your club 

Select specific branches for different relay types

Each branch includes *.dat ( relevant data for your club),
                     *.mod ( model description including all constraints and target function in AMPL language),
                     *.run ( script in AMPL),
                     text file ( in Dutch) describing rules for this type of relay.

To create the *.dat file I use VBA macro( MS Excell) and Python script.
