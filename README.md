# Relay-teams-orienteering
Create optimal orienteering relay teams for your club.  

Select specific folders for different relay types.  

Each folders includes:  
		
		*.mod (model description including all constraints and target function in AMPL language),  
		*.run (script in AMPL),  
		README.md (in Dutch) describing rules for this type of Relay competition.  

To create the *.dat file,I use Python script

To run the scripts, I recommend AMPL IDE or Neos Server.  

Enjoy!
