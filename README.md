# Relay-teams-orienteering
Create optimal orienteering relay teams for your club 

Select specific folders for different relay types

Each folders includes *.dat (relevant data for your club),
                      *.mod (model description including all constraints and target function in AMPL language),
                      *.run (script in AMPL),
                     README.md (in Dutch) describing rules for this type of Relay competition.

To create the *.dat file, I use VBA macro(MS Excel) and Python script.   
With param comp_team you can choose the number of competitive teams. Additional teams are balanced. 

To run the scripts, I recommend AMPL IDE or Neos Server.

Enjoy!
